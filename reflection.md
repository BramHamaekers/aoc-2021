# ðŸŽ„ AOC 2021 Reflection ðŸŽ„

### Day 1:
Happy with the oneliner solutions that I wrote today.
### Day 2:
Happy to have finally used the new Structural Pattern Matching feature 
in python 3.10.

Use of lambda function might be an improvement to the code.

### Day 3:
Probably should have made use of Pandas DataFrames. This would have made it easier
to access and manipulate both columns and rows.

Finding a different way to find the most common element
that doesn't need for calculating the dimensions of the matrix  would also
be preferable.

### Day 4:
Made use of Pandas DataFrames (as suggested in [Day 3](#day-3)). Although not a very efficient solution. I learned quite a lot
about Pandas during the process of figuring out a solution with it.

### Day 5:
Made use of own sparse matrix class to solve the puzzle. Probably going to try using my own datastructures
more in future puzzles.

### Day 6:
Once again made use of my own class. Very happy with the result as the solution is instant and today
was an optimisation problem. Testing -> can do 100000 days almost instantly

### Day 7:
Very short and easy solution. I had a bit of a problem with rounding errors. But overall found solution to
both problems quickly.

### Day 8: 
Not a clean looking or very efficient solution today. But it works. :)

### Day 9:
Part 2 took me longer than it should to find.
