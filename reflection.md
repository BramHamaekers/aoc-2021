# ðŸŽ„ AOC 2021 Reflection ðŸŽ„

## Day 1:
Happy with the oneliner solutions that I wrote today.
## Day 2:
Happy to have finally used the new Structural Pattern Matching feature 
in python 3.10.

Use of lambda function might be an improvement to the code.

## Day 3:
Probably should have made use of Pandas DataFrames. This would have made it easier
to access and manipulate both columns and rows.

Finding a different way to find the most common element
that doesn't need for calculating the dimensions of the matrix  would also
be preferable.

## Day 4:
Made use of Pandas DataFrames (as suggested in [Day 3](#day-3)). Although not a very efficient solution. I learned quite a lot
about Pandas during the process of figuring out a solution with it.
